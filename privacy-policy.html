                  The
                  <b>EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)</b>
                  comes into force across the European Union on 25th May 2018
                  and brings with it the most significant changes to data
                  protection law in two decades. Based on privacy by design and
                  taking a risk-based approach, the GDPR has been designed to
                  meet the requirements of the digital age.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-20">
                  The 21st Century brings with it broader use of technology, new
                  definitions of what constitutes personal data, and a vast
                  increase in cross-border processing. The new Regulation aims
                  to standardize data protection laws and processing across the
                  EU; affording individuals stronger, more consistent rights to
                  access and control their personal information.
                </p>

                  protection principles. However, we recognize our obligations
                  in updating and expanding this program to meet the demands of
                  the GDPR as well all other compliance laws.
